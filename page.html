<p>Chop Point </p>
<p>Chop Point is a non-profit organization operating a summer camp and K-12 
school in Woolwich, Maine.</p>
<div id="campOverview">
<p>Chop Point received accreditation from the American Camping Association 
and opened as a camp in Maine in 1967. Before the founding of Chop Point, the 
property had been operated as Merrymeeting camp for over fifty years. </p>
<p>Chop Point Summer camp combines a strong residential camping program 
designed specifically for teenagers, with the excitement of an adventurous trip 
program. Each summer, 80 teenagers between the ages of twelve and eighteen
come to Chop Point from all over the world to have one of the best summers
of their lives. The camp is located two hours up the Maine coast in the town 
of Woolwich. The property includes 50 wooded acres of land at the end of a 
peninsula, and a mile of shoreline on picturesque and historic Merrymeeting 
Bay, on the Kennebec River.</p>
<p>Buildings include a dining hall, a lodge, two homes, eight cabins, a new 
state-of-the-art gymnasium, and a boathouse. The boathouse was renovated into 
a Library and Learning Center, housing staff and computers in the summer. Chop 
Point also has a full size athletic field, tennis courts, basketball courts, a 
volleyball court and a well-equipped waterfront facility.</p>
<blockquote>What's the greatest asset of Chop Point? Founder Peter Willard said 
it best: "We firmly believe our greatest asset is our top-notch staff. Sixteen 
counselors, having completed at least a year of college, come from throughout 
the world. They bring their skill, enthusiasm and love of teenagers to camp, 
and strive to be a genuine friend to each camper."</blockquote>
<p>Chop Point is a recognized non-profit organization and strives to keep 
campers' and students' fees as affordable as possible. To do this, and still 
maintain the level of programs that we offer, we rely somewhat on outside 
donations. We have been provided with generous support from former campers, 
students, staff and friends. Many of the major improvements to the grounds, 
facilities and equipment are a direct result of their commitment to Chop 
Point.</p>
